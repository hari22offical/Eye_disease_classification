    <p><b>↪ PROBLEM STATEMENT:</b></p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
    More than 3.4 million people in the U.S. age 40 and older meet the definition of “legal blindness” (visual acuity of 20/200 or less in the better-seeing eye or visual field of 20 degrees or less) or have corrected vision (visual acuity of 20/40 or less), according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Almost 7% of U.S. children under the age of 18 have been diagnosed with an eye disease or condition. Nearly 3% of children under 18 are blind or whose vision is impaired. Vision loss is among the top 10 causes of disability in the U.S in adults over the age of 18 and one of the most common disabling conditions in children.

The good news is that it’s never too late to start taking care of your eye health. Regular eye health appointments and eye exams can lead to early diagnosis. This is key to correcting or slowing most eye conditions. Always see your eye care professional if your vision problem lasts for more than a few days or worsens</p>

    <p><b>🎯 OBJECTIVE:</b></p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
<h2>Objective for an Eye Disease Classification Model:</h2>

The objective of an eye disease classification model is to accurately classify different types of eye diseases or conditions based on medical images or clinical data. The model aims to assist ophthalmologists and healthcare professionals in diagnosing and treating eye diseases effectively by providing automated and reliable disease predictions.</p>

<h2>Notes on Image Classification Model for Kidney Stone Detection:</h2>
Choose an appropriate deep learning model architecture for image classification, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). CNNs have demonstrated exceptional performance in image classification tasks and are suitable for capturing spatial features in eye images.

<h6>Transfer Learning:</h6>
Utilize transfer learning by leveraging pre-trained models (e.g., ResNet, Inception, or VGGNet) that have been trained on large image datasets like ImageNet. Fine-tune the pre-trained model to adapt it to the specific task of eye disease classification. This approach helps in reducing training time and improving the model's performance.
